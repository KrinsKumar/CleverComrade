## üßê What it Does ü§î
Have you ever tried to ask AI for an answer to something you should know from class.... but just can't seem to find the answer to?  The output can be confusing and jargon filled, and without a proper explanation of what is going on at a comprehensible scope.  What about when the answer provided to you is just totally made up?

That's where your very smart and committed comrade comes in, to save the day!  With an in depth knowledge of all your course materials available on OneDrive, just ask Clever and get your answer!  Clever only uses the documents provided to it as a source of truth to minimize hallucination.

## How it Works üóíÔ∏è
Auth0 allows you to securely connect to your Microsoft OneDrive account through the CleverComrade web application.
Once connected, CleverComrade utilizes the documents within your OneDrive as its sources of truth for the responses it generates, ensuring the information it returns is accurate and valid.  

Not convinced? Clever will even tell you which of _**your**_ documents it got the information from for its answer!
